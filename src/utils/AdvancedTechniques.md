Universal Techniques
 Attack Weakness

suffer fatigue equal to however many conditions they already have 
marked.
 Charge
 advance & attack
 Advance straight at an enemy to strike them full force. Mark 1-fatigue 
to close the distance and engage with an enemy you aren’t currently 
engaged with, inflicting one condition or 2-fatigue (their choice). 
Become Favored for the next exchange.

harm’s way. Mark 1-fatigue to clear one condition and become Favored.

1-fatigue and inflict 2-fatigue or one condition on your target (your 
choice). Then push them to a new position of your choice unless they 
mark 2-fatigue.

inflict conditions equal to your Passion on an enemy; NPCs instead 
inflict conditions equal to their current balance. You may only remove

 Rapid Assessment
 evade & observe
 Quickly take in your situation far faster than normal. Ask one 
question about the situation at hand. Become Prepared to act on 
the answer, and you may call out your plan to an ally to make them 
Prepared as well.
 Seek Vulnerabilities
 evade & observe
 Examine your foe for weak points. The next time you inflict a condi
tion or fatigue on them, you may also shift their balance. If you know 
what their principle is, then you may mark 1-fatigue to shift their 
balance a second time.
 Sense Environment
 evade & observe
 Look for opportunities to usefully reshape your environment. The 
next time you advance and attack or defend and maneuver, you 
may use Smash or Ready, as appropriate, in addition to any other 
techniques you use, even on a miss. When you use Smash or Ready 
this way, do not mark fatigue.
 Stand Strong

 Plant your feet and prepare yourself for incoming blows. Become  
Prepared, and you automatically block or avoid any negative statuses 
inflicted on you this exchange.
 Suck It Up
 defend & maneuver

For each attack that inflicts fatigue, conditions, or balance shifts on 
you this exchange, choose one additional technique next exchange 
(even if you roll a miss on the stance move).

Group Techniques
 Attend to Commands
 evade & observe
 A leading voice in the group takes a moment to organize it effec
tively. The group clears Impaired, becomes Inspired, and inflicts an 
additional 1-fatigue on all attacks made next exchange.
 Coordination
 evade & observe
 The group sets itself up to launch a concerted, skilled attack upon its 
targets next exchange. The group becomes Prepared and Favored and 
may clear 2-fatigue or a condition (in addition to the normal 1-fatigue 
for evade and observe).
 Draw Foe 
evade & observe
 The group misleads foes into overextending themselves. The group 
targets an engaged foe who chose the advance and attack approach 
this exchange. That foe must mark 1-fatigue, becomes Impaired, and 
is moved out of reach of allies.
 Engulf
 defend & maneuver 
The whole group shifts forward en masse, engulfing their target and 
engaging them. An engulfed target becomes Impaired and cannot es
cape or disengage this exchange. The group automatically uses Strike 
against each Impaired foe within reach.
 Focused Fire
 advance & attack
 The group pours out all of its attacks simultaneously, in synchronized 
fashion, against the same target. Mark 1-fatigue to inflict 2-fatigue 
and a condition. If the group was Prepared for this attack, inflict an 
additional 2-fatigue and another condition.
 Overwhelm
 advance & attack
 Strike at every combatant in reach. All foes engaged with the group 
must mark 2-fatigue or one condition, their choice.
 Scatter and Regroup
 evade & observe
 The group splits apart and reforms nearby. The group clears one 
condition. Any foe engaged with the group is no longer engaged with 
the group, and the group can advance and engage with foes as it 
chooses; any foes the group engages with are Impaired.
 Shield Wall
 defend & maneuver
 The group together forms a barricade. The group becomes Favored, 
and ignores the first 2-fatigue and one condition it would mark this 
exchange. Next exchange, all movement or maneuvering past the 
shield wall is automatically blocked.
 Spread Out
 defend & maneuver
 The group spreads itself out to cover more ground and avoid 
large-scale attacks. The group cannot suffer more than 1-fatigue, 
one condition, or one balance shift from any individual attack—the 
attacker chooses which if necessary. The group can also engage 
with any foes in a much wider reach, and pays no cost to keep an 
engaged foe from escaping.
 Surround
 advance & attack
 The group closes around a single foe. Every additional attack made 
on that foe during this exchange inflicts an additional 1-fatigue. Every 
attack made by a surrounded foe forces them to suffer 1-fatigue.
 Swarm 
advance & attack
 The group throws itself upon a foe with no heed to its own safety. 
Mark 1-fatigue to inflict 2-fatigue on a single target. This technique 
may be chosen multiple times. Each time it is chosen after the first, it 
inflicts an additional 1-fatigue. 
Test Defenses
 evade & observe
 The group slowly probes the defenses of a foe, one or two mem
bers attacking individually to determine the foe’s abilities. The 
group becomes Prepared, Favored, Inspired, and learns the balance 
principle of its target; the chosen foe may immediately use Strike 
on the group in turn.
 Protect ObJective
 defend & maneuver
 The group surrounds a person, place, or object with their backs to it, to 
protect it from attack, disruption, or seizure. The group marks 2-fatigue 
and becomes Prepared. All foes near or engaged with the protected 
target become disengaged and pushed back from the target and are 
now engaged with the group. No foe can reach the protected target 
until the group is scattered or loses Prepared.

hold 1-for-1 to reduce the 1-fatigue or conditions inflicted by an in
coming attack by 1; to become Favored for the next exchange, as long

against you. Become Prepared, and at any time during this exchange,

spend hold—at least one—whenever an incoming attack would 
inflict fatigue or conditions.
 Earth Gauntlet

anything. Mark 1-fatigue and become Favored as long as the star is ac
tive. Every time you use the star as part of an attack, you can also cut

basic technique, at no additional cost. You may mark 1-fatigue at the 
end of each exchange to keep the star active.
